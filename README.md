# Banking-system
This project is a simple command-line banking system built in C++ that allows users to manage bank accounts. It demonstrates basic operations like creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, balance inquiries, and closing accounts. The account data is persisted using file handling for storage, allowing for data persistence across sessions.
